Trial 003 Observations - EXPERIMENTAL (With Network Shaping)
============================================================

PHASE 1 (0-45 seconds) - 20 Mbps bandwidth
- Started at 360p, ramped to 720p by 18 seconds
- Quality stabilized at 720p around 4000+ kbps
- Buffer built up to about 28 seconds
- Normal startup behavior, similar to baselines

PHASE 2 (45-90 seconds) - 1.5 Mbps bandwidth DROP
- Network change applied at T = 45
- YouTube continued at 720p for about 7 seconds (using buffer)
- First quality drop around T = 52 (bitrate decreased)
- Switched to 480p at T = 58
- Continued dropping to 360p around T = 78
- Buffer drained from 28s down to about 8s
- Quality reached lowest point ~847 kbps at 360p

PHASE 3 (90-135 seconds) - 20 Mbps RECOVERY
- Network restored at T = 90
- YouTube was conservative - didn't immediately jump to high quality
- Gradual increase: 360p -> 480p (T = 97) -> 720p (T = 118)
- Buffer started recovering around T = 97
- Ended at 720p (3891 kbps), didn't return to 1080p
- Buffer recovered to ~29 seconds by end

SUMMARY
- Total quality switches: 6
- Stalls/rebuffering: 0 (buffer got low but never empty)
- Maximum quality: 720p at 4156 kbps
- Minimum quality: 360p at 847 kbps
- Adaptation delay: ~13 seconds after bandwidth drop
- Notes: Clear ABR adaptation visible. YouTube used buffer to delay
         quality drops. Recovery was gradual rather than aggressive.
         Did not return to peak quality within observation window.
