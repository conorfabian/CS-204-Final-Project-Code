Trial 001 Observations - BASELINE (No Network Shaping)
======================================================

PHASE 1 (0-45 seconds)
- Video started at 480p, quickly ramped up
- Quality increased to 720p around 15 seconds
- Reached 1080p by approximately 45 seconds
- Buffer built up smoothly, no issues

PHASE 2 (45-90 seconds)
- Quality remained at 1080p throughout
- No network shaping applied, so no degradation expected
- Buffer stayed healthy around 33-36 seconds
- Playback was completely smooth

PHASE 3 (90-135 seconds)
- Continued stable 1080p playback
- Buffer level remained constant
- No quality switches observed
- Video ended normally

SUMMARY
- Total quality switches: 2 (480p->720p->1080p during startup)
- Stalls/rebuffering: 0
- Maximum quality reached: 1080p (5891 kbps)
- Minimum buffer: ~31 seconds
- Notes: Clean baseline run, YouTube quickly optimized to highest quality
