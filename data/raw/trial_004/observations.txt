Trial 004 Observations - EXPERIMENTAL (With Network Shaping)
============================================================

PHASE 1 (0-45 seconds) - 20 Mbps bandwidth
- Started at 480p, increased quickly
- Reached 720p by T = 14, then 1080p by T = 40
- This trial reached higher quality than trial 003 before bandwidth drop
- Buffer built to ~29 seconds

PHASE 2 (45-90 seconds) - 1.5 Mbps bandwidth
- Bandwidth dropped at T = 45
- Faster adaptation than trial 003 - started dropping at T = 50
- Went from 1080p -> 720p -> 480p -> 360p
- More aggressive quality reduction, reached 360p by T = 72
- Buffer dropped to minimum of about 6.8 seconds (lower than trial 003)
- Bitrate went down to ~876 kbps at lowest

PHASE 3 (90-135 seconds) - 20 Mbps
- Recovery started at T = 90
- Slow initial recovery (buffer was very low)
- Quality increases: 360p -> 480p (T=98) -> 720p (T = 119)
- Similar to trial 003, didn't return to 1080p
- Buffer recovered to ~26 seconds

SUMMARY
- Total quality switches: 7 (more than trial 003 due to reaching 1080p first)
- Stalls/rebuffering: 0 (close call at 6.8s buffer)
- Maximum quality: 1080p at 4891 kbps (before drop)
- Minimum quality: 360p at 876 kbps
- Adaptation delay: ~5 seconds (faster than trial 003)
- Notes: Started at higher quality, adapted faster but dropped harder.
         Lower minimum buffer suggests more aggressive use of buffer
         before quality switching. Recovery pattern similar to trial 003.
