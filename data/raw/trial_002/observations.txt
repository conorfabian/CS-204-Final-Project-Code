Trial 002 Observations - BASELINE (No Network Shaping)
======================================================

PHASE 1 (0-45 seconds)
- Started slightly slower than trial 001 at 360p
- Progressive quality increases: 360p -> 480p -> 720p -> 1080p
- Took until around 45 seconds to reach 1080p
- Buffer building was steady

PHASE 2 (45-90 seconds)
- Maintained 1080p quality
- Small fluctuation around 72s (dropped to ~5423 kbps briefly)
- Buffer stayed in 31-36 second range
- No visible quality degradation

PHASE 3 (90-135 seconds)
- Stable 1080p throughout
- Buffer levels consistent
- Smooth playback continued
- No issues observed

SUMMARY
- Total quality switches: 3 during startup ramp
- Stalls/rebuffering: 0
- Maximum quality reached: 1080p (5812 kbps)
- Minimum buffer: ~29 seconds
- Notes: Slightly slower startup than trial 001, but same end result.
         Minor bitrate variation around 72s but resolution stayed 1080p.
